# Chatup

# Getting Started

First you'll want to clone the the repository down.

```
git clone https://github.com/josh-W42/chatup
```

From this point, you'll install the necessary dependencies
for both the client and the server.

```
npm install
```

Then to start the development servers you'll run:
On the Front-End:

```
npm start
```

On the backend:

```
npm run start:dev
```

And you should be all set for local testing.

# Project Structure

I approached this project with the I idea of building out an MVC architecture, with the model being a firebase real-time database, the view being a Node.js backend and then a React-typescript front-end for the view.
